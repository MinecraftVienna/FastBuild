# FastBuild
FastBuild is a plugin to build simple roofes at any type of house, no matter how odd it is shaped.

How it works:

1) Build a house with a flat area at the top (or any type of flat area that is seperated to other areas by at least one block)
2) Look at the the flat area and enter the command /build roof <Material> <height>, where Material can be any item Id or minecraft name and height is the number of Blocks the roof should be high.
3) Done
